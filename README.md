> This is a weather web-app that can retrieve the current weather for your current city or the one you type.

</p>

In this project, I use async functions to get data from the following sources:

- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers)
- [Google Geolocation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview)

To let the app know your current city, enable the location permission on your browser, by default you will be asked the first time you load the page. 


## Live Demo
I will feel honored if you try my app and tell me how to improve it.
It is hosted on a Netlify Free account so be patient, sometimes it takes a while to load.
